# FinancialPilot

This project was fully designed and build by me (Riad Hallouch).

Also this is my biggest porject so far, fully done by me!

## Functionalities still to be added:

- Making the pagination on the home page work.
- Adding a settings tab, to modify user's name
- Maybe add functionality to upload user's avatar.
- Making the Darkmode work.
- Making the UI fully responsive.
- Adding the possiblity to delete or modify transactions.
- Adding filtering transaction (eg: By status, by amount, by date ...etc).
